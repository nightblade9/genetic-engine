# Genetic Engine

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/nightblade9/genetic-engine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/nightblade9/genetic-engine)

A simple genetic engine, for applying genetic programming or genetic algorithms to your C# projects.

You can see the `SampleSolutions` project as a sample. It uses genetic programming to derive an algorithm to generate solutions to various problems:

- The backpacking problem (optimizing value given weight and limited capacit)
- Linear regression (curve fitting)
